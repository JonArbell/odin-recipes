            Adobo is a popular Filipino dish known for its savory and tangy flavors.
        </h2>

        <h3><br>Here are the ingredients typically used in adobo, along with a brief description:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>
                    Chicken or Pork:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Adobo can be made with either <em>chicken</em> or <em>pork</em>, or sometimes a combination of both. The meat is typically cut into pieces and marinated in a mixture of vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, and spices.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>
                    Vinegar:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    <em>Vinegar</em> is a key ingredient in adobo, providing its distinctive tangy flavor. It also helps to tenderize the meat during the cooking process.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>
                    Soy Sauce:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    <em>Soy sauce</em> adds a salty and savory flavor to adobo. It also contributes to the rich, dark color of the dish.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>
                    Garlic:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    <em>Garlic</em> is used to flavor the adobo marinade, providing a robust and aromatic element to the dish.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>
                    Bay Leaves:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    <em>Bay Leaves</em> are often added to adobo for their earthy and slightly floral flavor. They infuse the dish with subtle herbal notes.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>
                    Whole Peppercorns:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    <em>Whole Peppercorns</em> are added to the adobo marinade to provide a hint of spiciness and depth of flavor.
                </p>
            </li>

            
            <li>
                <h4>
                    Water or Broth:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    <em>Water or Broth</em> is used to dilute the marinade and create the cooking liquid for simmering the meat until tender.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>
                    Oil:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    <em>Oil</em> is used for sautéing the garlic and searing the meat before simmering it in the marinade, adding richness to the dish.
                </p>
            </li>

        </ul>
